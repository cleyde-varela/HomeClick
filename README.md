# HomeClick

## ðŸ“Œ About this project
HomeClick is an Android App for home surveillance developed in Kotlin.
The application intends to serve as a central point for monitoring the various devices found in homes, specifically, the door locks, the lamps, the thermostat, and 
the irrigation system, allowing the user to turn on, off, and configure any of these through their mobile device.
  
## ðŸ“Œ The reason behind it
This app was built in collaboration with my great colleague **JessÃ© Sacramento** (https://github.com/JesseSacramento01) as the final project for (I dare to say) my favorite subject so far, *Programming for Mobile Apps*.
We initially had the idea during another subject, *Person Computer Interaction* in which we elaborated on the app's analysis and design, we first drafted the screens and then using
Balsamiq created the wireframes for the medium-fidelity design. We then implemented all the visuals using Java.
Later, we made some modifications and improvements to the project and switched to Kotlin now implementing functionality.

## ðŸ“Œ Specifications
